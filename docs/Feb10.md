Prior: had to defeat Shenku in dreamworld. Shenku ended up being Godline Fanlin, who is split across seven artifacts - all dark in nature.

### Still in dreamworld

Godling Fanlin -- 9th level sorcerer -- was the little boy we got out of the staff
    described that we took the rough way of getting him out
    could have purified him in the waters of his temple -- was in the center of GoldCliffe. Also present in most major cities
    META(not known to Mepo)   He's a rare twin god that created the world
    Mepo only worships Teamot, so all other gods are false gods. But fanlin and his brother created all other gods

### Godling Fanlin boops us, and we wake back up in GoldCliffe (Raven's Roost)

    Artificer Raven greets us as we wake up. Mepo raises with one hell of a hangover, along with Wayne.
    Doyle is seemingly short and explains that he had the god Fanlin in his head.
    Raven seems distraught, and wants time to study and build a containment chamber for the artifact, which is slowly turning dark again in nature.
    She also needs four buckets of celestial water from the temple. A priest will be commissioned to constantly bless it.

### On the way to the temple

    We've decided to stop by the row of shops in town. 
    Greil visits a store called Pop and Pipes, which is run by an elderly man. He's smoking a pipe and greets the team. "Y'all in the market for a pipe, or maybe some red bush?" Greil buys 5 red bush and a pipe, shaped like a bear and inlaid with gold. Pineapple, mac and cheese, cinnamon, cookies and creme.

    ## We visit two tattoo shops which rival. A brother and a Sister(Tithlings(devil people)).
    Mepo, Calcryx, and Doyle are waiting outside.
        Inksmith and Roger & Tita Tattoo
        Tita is a purple tithling covered head to toe in dark magnificent tattoos. They're glowing and shifting.
            She's working on a dward who appears to be struggling in pain.
        Roger has a more vintage shop, which appears to be "oxford gentlemen's club" in nature.
            Very hipster, also covered in tattoos, and has silver piercings. Very much the same style as Tita.
            He's working on a half-elf woman, her shirt is off and he's tattooing her back.
        Greil visits Tita, and they really seem to hit it off. He shows her his drinking horn, and she seems intrigued.
            They flirt for a bit, and Greil offers to buy drinks for everyone in the store, in return for a "rush" favor.
            She pencils him in for an appointment, for a tattoo that helps with damage during battle.
        Wayne visits Roger's shop, and is greeted by a smoking bar and coffee. He asked about getting two tattoos with a materializing knife.
            He was assurred that was a common - easy tattoo. He gets penciled in for 3 days from now.
        Greil suggested getting a tattoo that says "MOM" with a bloody arrow through it - to symbolize the killing of the kobald queen.
    Greil and Wayne come out of the stores, Doyle is leaning on a wall.
    Mepo takes some time to play with Calcryx, and feeds her a steak bit.
        Calcryx is visibly exhausted, and doesn't react to much. Mepo picks her up, and she eats the steak bit out of his hand. Mepo cradles her.

    The group visits fantasy home depot, and is greeted with a small man shouting "DECK BUILDING". He appears to be excited about building decks.
        Doyle gets a bucket of black paint, and a paintbrush. He tries to tag a wall, but gets caught and chased by city guards.
            He transforms into a Gecko and avoids the guards by crawling up the walls. Jumped onto the guard unnoticed, and sneaked into a crevice in the guard's armor.
        Mepo tried to talk to the deck guy(Brian) to acquire some colored stones, but he is referred to the jewelry shop down the street. Arguing ensues, and Mepo tries to convince the deck builder that small stones are normal on decks. Brian persists and says he's never seen stones on a deck before.

    In front of the jeweler shop, Calcryx is sitting on Mepo's shoulder purring. Greil finally finds the Jeweler shop as well, and yells "HEEY"! Mepo kind of nods in an attempt to not wake Calcryx.
        Entering the shop, it's sorted by color. A small human girl in a pointy witches hat.
        Mepo engages in conversation, and asks about powering up the goldfish. She is very intrugued and wanted to touch it.
        Blubbers swims up to the end of the water bubble, and boops her finger.
        She explains that "Blubbers" is an incredibly rare arcane focus, and molds to the user.
        There were also no upgrades that could be added to Blubbers.
        Mepo asks about getting a nametag made for Calcryx with pearlescent fire opal, but is having an identity crisis with Calcryx and needs to come back. He asks her to think of designs for Calcryx.

    The three of us meet up outside of the smithy, where Wayne purchased a cane sword. As a group, we wonder where Doyle went.
    <flashback to Doyle> Doyle ends up licking the guard's ear, and they are also headed to the temple.

### At the temple

    The group is greeted by priests and priestesses from both religions (White and gold, black and silver).
    They check out our buckets and make sure they are satisfactory. We are then guided to the ritual baths. It's a massive black-onyx bathing area with carved animal spouts. We're offered purifying ritual baths for 5GP.
    Doyle appears out of nowhere, and shifts back into a person. He is not satisfied with the bath pricing.
    Greil pays the 5 silver and strips naked to cannonball.
    Meanwhile, Doyle and Mepo are filling the buckets with the blessed bath water.
