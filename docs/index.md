# The story of Mepo

Mepo Dragonsbreadth is a Kobald Warlock Folk Hero who grew up with his wyrmling - Calcryx - and served his Kobald queen in the [Kobald Dungeon]().  
Mepo was a simple Kobald, who spent every day creating wood art to sell, only to pay tribute to the Queen. But not to worry, his one and only care in the world was taking care of Calcryx, who was growing larger than ever imaginable.

## The day Mepo's life turned upside down

### The adventurers arrive

A group of adventurers was exploring the cave of Mepo's residence, looking for the [Fruit of Life](). They had killed everyone in their path, and when they reached Mepo, he and Calcryx were ready to kill them. After all, this was his home; this was where Mepo built his life.

### Mepo turns against his Kobald Queen

Rather than killing Mepo, the adventurers engaged in conversation. Much to Mepo's surprise, he took a liking to them. They were surprisingly friendly, and certainly better than the queen. They helped Mepo realize what a horrible life he was living, and that he need not serve his queen any longer. He took a liking to one adventurer in particular, Greil, who for some reason keept giving him crackers. Now _this_ was a life he could get used to.  
Teaming up with the adventurers, who Mepo was now slightly acquainted with, he set off with the goal to kill the Kobald Queen, and free himself and Calcryx from her grasp. 

## The dungeon

Mepo had lived in this cave for the better part of his life, but was not well acquainted with the lower parts. The more powerful folk lived down there, and it was not safe for simple folk. In fear of dying or being recognized, he stayed towards the back of the party, hiding behind Greil. The party fought off many twig blights and goblins while exploring the dungeon. Mepo, now facing his life's dillemma, contemplated what he just got himself into. His main attack was the [Eldritch Blast](), which he had perfected many years ago - to give a finishing touch to some of his art - and it actually turned out to be quite useful.

Mepo, not much of a fighter, grabbed a femur from one of the monsters after it had been killed.
